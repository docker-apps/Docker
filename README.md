# Docker
*An android game about cargo ships, containers and cranes.*

## Project description
Initially, this project was started as a school exercise. 
But as we liked the concept, we expanded and polished the game for another 6 months and
eventually released it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docker.android)!

The game is implemented with the awesome [*libGDX* game development framework](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

## The Game
In Docker, your task is to load containers of different sizes and weights on a cargo ship. You have to stack them not only efficiently, but make sure the ship is balanced too, otherwise the ship may capsize or even break in half!

A simple, but challenging puzzle game with various features:

* Career mode with 10 levels and more coming
* Quick game with random generated levels
* Enjoy the retro pixel artwork and try to beat your own and your friends highscores.
* Requires no internet connection, you can play it anywhere, anytime you want.
* Expect Updates with more features, levels and game modes.

You can [download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docker.android) it on your android phone via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.docker.android)
